# Introduction to Agile Query

Agile Query is a self-service data analysis system designed for enterprises. Compared to traditional BI systems, it not only significantly reduces data development costs but also addresses increasingly complex data analysis requirements. With an integrated powerful SQL compiler, Agile Query automatically constructs optimal SQL queries based on the relationships between different database tables and encapsulates numerous domain-specific query functions. This enables business personnel and data analysts to independently perform data analysis tasks. 

- **Intelligent Multi-Table Query**: By automatically identifying relationships between tables, intelligent multi-table querying generates optimal SQL statements, eliminating the need for manually writing complex join operations. 
- **Multi-Table Calculation Formulas**: By defining formulas involving fields from different tables, users can execute complex data operations such as aggregation, statistical analysis, and data transformation. 
- **Nested Aggregate Formulas**: This feature allows embedding one aggregate function within another, enabling data analysts and database administrators to perform multi-level data summarization and calculations, thereby uncovering deeper trends and patterns within the data. 
- **Multi-Dimensional Calculation Formulas**: Multi-dimensional calculation formulas facilitate computations and aggregations across multiple dimensions in data analysis. By defining calculated members within multi-dimensional datasets, users can create formulas involving various dimensions to execute complex data operations. 
- **Dynamic Classification**: Based on rules derived from multiple aggregated data points, dynamic classification categorizes specified dimensions to implement complex classification rules such as customer profiling, tagging, and product categorization. This approach leverages multi-dimensional analysis techniques, aligning with business requirements to build a refined tagging system. It aids enterprises in gaining deeper insights into customer characteristics and product attributes, facilitating the development of precise marketing strategies and optimized product classifications. 
- **Growth Analysis**: Through built-in functions, Agile Query enables growth rate analysis over various time periods, including year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons. Additionally, it supports combining other dimensions to conduct multi-dimensional growth rate analyses, meeting complex data analysis needs.
